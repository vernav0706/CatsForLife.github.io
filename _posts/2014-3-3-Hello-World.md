title: why cats are fun to be around with

Cats are fun to be around because they are calm and quiet. Mostly all cats are calm and sleep/nap all day. Sometimes the cats dont even bother us just only when it is time to eat. Also cats love to play around and you dont even need expensive toys to play with them. All you need is a shoelace to play with.
