## Product Review 

 The product is a scratching post. Nothing to special about them but they do help with cats that like to claw everything. The cats posts help a lot because they are made with materail that cats love to put their nails in. The cats love cat posts, and sometimes they have a mouse hanging from one of the tall post (which the cats go crazy for) 
 
## Pros and Cons

There are a lot of pros but not really any cons becuase there is barely anything that can go wrong with this. The pros on this is the cats will love it and they inculde different materials that the cats will enjoy to stick their nails in. The materials include fur and Scratching rope. Almost all the post come with a place for the cats to lay and rest so that is also another pro for this. I would say the only cons for the product is sometimes the mouses that come attached usually come off after time but that is just with the normal wear and tear. 

## Other Options 

There are a lot of places to get scratching post but here is where they are mainy options and different price pionts to get the [Scratching Post](https://www.chewy.com/b/scratchers-393) 

## Why I recomend getting a Scrathing Post 

This a nice little gift to get for your cat. They have a place to scratch and play and even rest when they feel tired after playing around. Cats will love to play with these all day and it keeps them intertanted for most of the day.
