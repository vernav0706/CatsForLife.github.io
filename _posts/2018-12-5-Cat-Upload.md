## Cute Cats 


Cats are cute because they are small furry creatures that love to cuddle, sleep, eat, and pretty much do nothing. 
They are easy to take care of and there is really no effort involved in taking care of them.
The cat above is a lovely black Median Domestic hair cat (which is the bred of the cat).
